#### Fun facts

- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.

- I can't locate every country on a map.
- I operate a [small angel fund](http://skepticalinvestments.biz/) with terrible returns.
- I break about 30 traffic laws on an [electric skateboard](https://boostedboards.com/vehicles/shortboards/boosted-mini-x), [onewheel](https://onewheel.com/products/xr), or [bicycle](https://www.citibikenyc.com/) every single day.
- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just a resume.

#### I dream of

- making the world a better place
